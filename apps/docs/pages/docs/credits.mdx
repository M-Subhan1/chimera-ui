- [Shadnc/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/). I came up with the idea for this project independently. As I started working on this, I came across shadnc/ui and was surprised to see how similar our ideas were. Shadcn/ui was much further along, so I was able to adapt a lot of the work that he did. Huge shout out to him!
- [Daisy UI](https://daisyui.com/), for inspiring the semantic color system
- [Adam Wathan](https://twitter.com/adamwathan) and [Steve Schoger](https://twitter.com/steveschoger) for creating [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) and writing [Refactoring UI](https://www.refactoringui.com/). A book that has helped me a lot in designing this library!
