# About Chimera

Chimera is an opinionated UI library made for React and Tailwind.

- **Accessible** - Chimera uses Radix Primitives under the hood for interactive components like accordions and selects
- **Themeable & Reusable** - Chimera components come pre-styled with a semantic color system (such as bg-primary). This makes it easy to switch themes and re-use components across apps. Similar to Daisy UI.
- **Customizable** - Components come with sensible default styles that look great out of the box, but can be completely customized with Tailwind utility classes (we use tailwind-merge under the hood to handle this). The result is faster development and cleaner code!
